# Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is useful in Machine Learning. It is required  for cleaning data and making it suitable for a machine learning model which also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model. I will try to demonstrate my personal data preprocessing skills to clean a dataset, encode categorical variables, split the data into training and testing sets as well as feature scaling.
## About This Project
..* This project aims to clean data and make the data ready before applying any machine learning algorithms, since data preprocessing is useful as it determines the accuracy of any Machine Learning model. The dataset used for this project was the Titanic dataset, downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file).

## Objectives
To get hands on experience in performing data preprocessing before applying machine learning algorithms.

## Libraries used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit learn

## Preprocessing
The following steps were taken in achieving the objectives set:
* Importing the required libraries - Numpy and Pandas
* Importing the dataset
* Fill missing values in case of any. The missing values were replaced by the column means
* Encode categorical variables
* Splitting the datasets into training and testing set in the ratio 7:3
* Feature scaling to make sure no variable dominates over the other, with standardization being employed in this case.
